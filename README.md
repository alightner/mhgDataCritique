# Code repo for the data critique on moralizing high gods in the SCCS

In a paper, titled *Cross-cultural datasets systematically underestimate the presence of moralizing gods in small-scale societies*, I critique the moralizing high gods variable in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) with Theiss Bendixen and Ben Purzycki.

## How to replicate our plots

To replicate our plots, the central script to run is the `analysis.R` script. All other scripts are sourced from this one, but they can be run (or skipped) if you want to only run a specific part of the analysis.
